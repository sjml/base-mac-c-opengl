# OpenGL Base

This is meant as a starting point for C/C++ OpenGL programs on the Mac. All it does is set up the (often confusing) Xcode build settings to produce a proper application bundle. When run, it opens a 1024x768 window rendering nothing. 

If you want to use more advanced OpenGL features, change the window handling, add input, whatever, you can add all that. But this is just the goofy boilerplate taken care of.
